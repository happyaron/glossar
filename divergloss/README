About
=====

Divergloss is an XML glossary format with emphasis on ease of plain-text
editing, incremental features, and immediate practical utility.

This package contains the format definition and documentation, and associated
processing tools. Important stops in the directory tree are as follows:

    dgproc/ -- processing tools
        dg/ -- Python module
            doc/ -- module documentation
        dtd/ -- format definition
        po/ -- translations for the module and and tools
    doc/ -- general documentation
    example/ -- examples of glossaries

In particular, the main glossary processor is the script dgproc/dgproc.py,
which is used to produce various output formats from a glossary file.
See Appendix A. of doc/divergloss.html for examples of its operation.

Installation
============

The processing tools use lxml Python module, which is not a part of standard
Python distribution. Install it from you distribution packages, or download
it from http://codespeak.net/lxml/.

The package may be installed using the pythonic ./setup.py script, but this
is not recommended at the moment due to the early development state.
Instead, to use the scripts in dgproc/, just add this directory to PATH.
To test that the setup works, execute:

    $ dgproc.py example/cosmogloss.xml

and you should get no output if everything is fine.

Also, if there is a translation into your language in dgproc/po/, you can
make translations ready for use by executing:

    $ dgproc/po/update-po.sh compile

Translations is used not only for the messages issued by tools, but also
for the text added into various glossary outputs as produced by dgproc.py.

Running the update-po.sh without arguments will do the following:

  - extract the PO template
  - merge all translations
  - compile translations into MO

Each of this phases can be run separately by giving as argument one of:
extract, merge, compile.

Compiled MO files are put into ../mo, using proper locale hierarchy
such that they get picked up automatically by dgproc scripts
when run directly from the repository (without installing).
MO files and ../mo subdirectory are ignored by version control.

Run periodically to bring updated translations into action, possibly in the
compile-only mode if you do not want to touch template and translations.
